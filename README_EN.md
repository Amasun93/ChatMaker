# ChatMaker

**An AI creative partner for beginners building delightful hardware and web projects.**

ChatMaker helps teachers, students, and hackathon participants move from a clear request or a rough idea to an implemented and verified project. The user chooses the direction and judges the visible result. ChatMaker handles concept development, professional implementation, tools, and evidence.

> Early development status: the Nano/Mind+ runtime and six compiled examples are on public `main`. The first structured pack contains eight components and seven recipes. Physical upload, broader module coverage, and the ChatWeb runtime are still in development.

## Architecture

```text
ChatMaker
├─ ChatDuino   hardware, wiring, firmware, compile, upload, serial
└─ ChatWeb     front-end creation, classroom tools, device UI, browser checks
```

- **ChatMaker** adapts to how clear the user's idea is and routes the project.
- **ChatDuino** turns effects into safe wiring, complete firmware, compilation, upload, and physical checks.
- **ChatWeb** proposes two or three curated visual directions and builds classroom tools, creative interactions, and hardware interfaces.

Beginner projects use one self-contained HTML file by default. Advanced style catalogs and a playground appear only when requested. Wiring uses one plain `text` block by default; SVG diagrams are optional and never replace the text source of truth.

## Philosophy

> ChatMaker = creative-partner philosophy + professional facts + executable tools + verification evidence

Skills guide judgment and define facts that must not be guessed. Scripts and runtime tools handle repeatable or fragile operations. Knowledge packs hold boards, components, libraries, examples, and visual patterns for progressive loading.

Compilation, firmware upload, browser interaction, serial evidence, and physical effects remain separate completion gates.
